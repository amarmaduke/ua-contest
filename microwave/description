# Microwave

Joseph really likes frozen burritos.
In fact, he eats them almost every night for dinner!
It's really easy to cook frozen burritos, you just throw them into a microwave, push a couple of numbered buttons, and hit start.
However, when you've been ``cooking'' burritos for as long as Joseph you start to mix things up, both intentionally and unintentionally.

Joseph has mastered the art of entering in the correct time for the frozen burritos.
He can enter 1, 3, 0, to cook for one minute and 30 seconds, or he can enter 9, 0, to cook for the same time.
Joseph has had a lot of microwaves in his life time, but there is on fact that's always the same:
The microwave will display the remaining time in terms of four digits split by a colon.
The first two representing remaining minutes, and the second two representing remaining seconds.

Although Joseph is a master of entering the correct time, he has a lot of trouble figuring out exactly how much time is left.
Your job is to assist him in this respect.
That is, given the display of the microwave, report the remaining total seconds until the microwave is done.

# Input

The input starts with an integer k (1 < k < 100) the number of total cases. The next k integers d_i (0 < d_i < 10000, 0 <= i < k) correspond to the ith display time.

# Output

For each test case, output the total seconds until the microwave is done.

# Sample Input

2
0010
0100

# Sample Output 

10
60
