D: Smarties

Smarties are multi-colored, disk shaped candies that come in a clear package. For this problem, we will assume there are only four colors (red, blue, green, yellow). After having eaten several candies, you devise a game in which you will score how you eat a package. These candies are ordered inside of the package, and you have restricted yourself to only eating candies at either the end of the package. You like some colors of the candies better than others and therefore score eating those candies higher than ones you do not prefer. Red candies are worth 4, blue candies are worth 3, green candies are worth 2, and finally, yellow candies are worth 1. Another condition is that eating multiple candies of the same color in a row increase a multiplier. Finally, the nth candy that you eat provides a multiplier of n (i.e. the first candy eaten provides a multiplier of 1, the second a multiplier of 2 and so on). The final formula for calculating the value of a specific candy is (value of candy color) * (number of this color candy eaten in a row) * (position candy was eaten).
Details of the Input
The input begins with an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) indicating the number of candies in a package. Next is a string representing the ordering of the smarties in the package. This string will only consist of the characters, R, B, G, and Y representing the colors red, blue, green and yellow respectively. An n of 0 represents the end of input and should not be processed.
Details of the Output
For each case, output the maximum possible score.
