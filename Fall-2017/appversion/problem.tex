\begin{problem}{A: Bleeding Edge}
Samwell wants to be on the bleeding edge for his flashlight app on his new iPhone X.
He cares a lot about this, so he's asked you to write a program that will execute every milisecond on his phone to check.
The appstore will report a version number for the flashlight app and Samwell wants to know if he has the latest version.
Samwell has discovered that sometimes the appstore will bug out and report a version older than the one he already has.
In that case you're to report that he has the latest version regardless.
\end{problem}

\begin{formalin}
The only line of input consists of two integers, $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n, m \leq 1000$).
The first integer, $n$, is the version Samwell currently has.
The second integer, $m$, is the version reported by the appstore.
\end{formalin}

\begin{formalout}
Output the word ``YES'' (without quotes) if Samwell has the latest version and ``NO'' (without quotes) otherwise.
\end{formalout}

\begin{datain}
10 100
\end{datain}

\begin{dataout}
NO
\end{dataout}

\begin{datain}
100 10
\end{datain}

\begin{dataout}
YES
\end{dataout}
