\begin{problem}{F: Inside Out}

Things can look really weird when you turn them inside out.
This includes words!
To turn a word inside out, take the middle letter first, and then alternate taking a letter from each side, first from the left and then from the right.
This process starts with the letters directly adjacent to the middle letter and moves toward the end.
If the word is even in length, take the higher of the two middle letters for the process.
\end{problem}

\begin{formalin}
The only line of input is a single word, $s$, ($1 \leq$ length of $s \leq 20$).
\end{formalin}

\begin{formalout}
On a single line, output the inside out string.
\end{formalout}

\begin{datain}
abcde
\end{datain}
\begin{dataout}
cbdae
\end{dataout}

\begin{datain}
abcdef
\end{datain}
\begin{dataout}
dcebfa
\end{dataout}
