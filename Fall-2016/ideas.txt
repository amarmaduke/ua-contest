Use this function f(x), to determine if this series of bits is from a troll!
input: bitstring
solution f(bitstring)
output: Yes, No

C. Hydra
Hydras are really scary! Defeat this hydra in the minimum number of cuts!
(using the hydra described in that one research paper)
input: DAG
solution: greedy?
output: min # of cuts

You have X amounts of ants that survived!
In a graph! Oh no! Graph problems are scary!
You have target locations with larvae, get all the larvae out in the minimum
number of steps possible! Using as many ants as are available to you!
input: graph, ant locations, larvae locations, exit location
solution: floyds (? can we do better?) + some trivial greedy assignments
output: minimum number of steps

E. Phoenix
When a phoenix dies it can be reborn with one of many different colors.
Each color has an associated cost. Each lifespan as an associated maximum lifetime.

The Phoenix starts red with a lifetime of 10.
Red: 5, Blue: 2, Orange: 9,
What is the maximum cost of the course of x life times?
input: Initial state, costs, maximum lifetime bound, bonus
solution: dynamic?
output: maximum cost possible
