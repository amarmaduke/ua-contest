\begin{problem}{A: Favorite Words}
Vanessa is trying to find her favorite collection of ``words.''
A ``word'' for Vanessa is any sequence of four letters, where a letter is a lowercase letter from the English alphabet.
The letters ``a'', ``b'', ..., ``z'' are the valid letters.
The words ``abdd'' and ``zzcd'' are examples of valid words.

On some days Vanessa really dislikes certain letters.
Sometimes she wants a lot of words, sometimes not a lot.
Her dream app is to have a ``word of the day'' program that adheres to her specific interests.
She's asked you to write a program to find her the collection of words she's most into on any particular day.
\end{problem}

\begin{formalin}
The first line consists of three integers, $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 25$), the number of characters Vanessa dislikes, $m$ ($1 \leq m \leq 3 \dot 10^5$), the $m$th word you should start recording, and $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 100$), the number of words in the collection.
The next line consists of $n$ alpha letters, the letters that Vanessa dislikes.
\end{formalin}

\begin{formalout}
Output $k$ ``words'', one word on each line, the ``words of the day''.
