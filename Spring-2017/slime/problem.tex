\begin{problem}{B: Slime}
Tanya is working in a lab researching slime specimens. She found that every second each slime splits in two and can do so indefinitely.

This means that if at this second there were 4 slimes, in 1 second there would be 8, and after two more seconds she would have 32.

Help Tanya find the number of slimes she will have after a specified number of seconds have passed, assuming that she always starts with 1 slime. 
\end{problem}

\begin{formalin}
Input consists of one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 30$). The number of seconds Tanya will have pass before recording the number of slimes.
\end{formalin}

\begin{formalout}
Output the number of slimes present after $n$ seconds.
