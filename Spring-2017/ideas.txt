1. Polish Calculator (Simulation)
    Your friend wants you to write a calculator for him,
    because he loves polish notation.
    And his calculator doesn't do that.

2. Catalan Numbers (Dynamic Programming n^2 )
    Given n, how many different ways can you match n-pairs of paranthesis?
    Blah-blah is interested in different encodings of numbers for his new slick programming language Parenren
    He wants to know just how many different ways he can put things together

3. Generate Constrained Strings (Brute Forcing + Backtracking?)
    Generate the nth lexographically ordered string
    but don't count strings that have these substrings!

4. Compute Powers of 2 (Dirt Simple, nothing larger than 2^30)

5. Integer Sequences + Range Queries (Dynamic Programming + Segment or Fenwick Tree)
    Given two recurrence relations

6. Shortest Path with p-adic numbers (Graphs + Implementation)
    Given a quick debrief on p-adic numbers, or at least the "metric space"
    Figure out that what we want is shortest path, implement a p-adic number,
    then implement dijkstras to solve


--- Cut --- (Below this lines are ideas that are cut)
4. Minimum Piano Hand Transitions (Dynamic Programming)
    Given a position of one hand on the piano, and ways in which you can move
    Find the minimum cost path across the piano such that you can play all the chords
Why? Catalan numbers above went from "just know the formula" to "dynamic programming" making this one redundant
