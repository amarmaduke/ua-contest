\begin{problem}{A: Operations}

Thomas is really, really bad at math.
He is so incredibly bad at math that he can't compute simple operations.
However, he is a pretty handsome guy and his charisma roll was high, so he's managed to convince you to help him out.

In particular, Thomas needs you to tell him the answer to a computation of the form $x {op} y$, where $x$ and $y$ are single digit numbers, and ${op}$ is one of either $+, -, *, /$.
For each given operation Thomas only cares about the truncated integral result.
Thus, the result of $5 / 2$ is $2$, not $2.5$.
Help Thomas out!

\end{problem}

\begin{formalin}
The input starts with one integer, $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 100$).
The next $n$ lines have three characters, $x$, $p$, and $y$.
Both $x$ and $y$ are integers ($1 \leq x, y \leq 9$).
And $p$ is either $+$, $-$, $*$, or $/$.
\end{formalin}

\begin{formalout}
For each input triple output the result of the applying the operation to the two given integers.
\end{formalout}

\begin{datain}
4
1 + 2
9 * 9
1 / 9
2 - 3
\end{datain}

\begin{dataout}
3
81
0
-1
\end{dataout}
