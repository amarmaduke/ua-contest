Word Search
Given a string S separated by standard ascii spaces.
You have the ability to move over a word in O(1) and over a character in O(1)
You have to reach some index i.
How can you get there in the least cost?
Solution?
   Just greedy, move as many words as necessary (backtrack on the last word that pushes you over)
   Then move the necessary amount of characters from either side, pick the min.

Given a number, N, and a set of numbers X.
What is the minimum sequence of numbers a_1, ..., a_n
such that a_1 + ... + a_n = N where a_i in X for all i
Possibly add the constraint that numbers in X can only be used so many times
Solution?
   I believe you can split this into sub problems fairly easily
   So either divide and conquer, prunned search, or dp should solve it
