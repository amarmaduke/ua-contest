\begin{problem}{D: Shrek and Dumbrix}

Shrek loves puzzle games.
One of his favorite games is Numbrix.
In this game, you are given a 9 by 9 starting grid with some positions containing values and some blank.
The point of the game is to fill in the blank spots so that there is a continuous chain of numbers between 1 and 81.
In other words, all values from 2 to 80 are directly connected to the values 1 greater and 1 less than themselves.
Connections are only allowed through single movements on the vertical and horizontal axes (i.e. no diagonal movement).
It is guaranteed that each Numbrix grid has only 1 possible solution.

Shrek likes Numbrix, but he thinks it might be too hard for you.
He has decided to relax the rules a little bit so you might have a chance of solving the puzzles too.
In his revised version of the game, Dumbrix, he provides two additional guarantees.
The given board always contains the numbers 1 and 81.
Also, for any continuous sequence of values between 1 and 81 of length $\geq 6$ at least one value in the sequence exists in the given board.
\end{problem}

\begin{formalin}
The input consists of 9 lines each containing 9 integer values.
The value at each line $i$ and position $j$, $v_{i,j}$ ($0 \leq v_{i,j} \leq 81$), represents its corresponding board position's value.
Positions with a value of 0 represent unknown values.
\end{formalin}

\begin{formalout}
Output the solved board with a single space between each value in a row and a new line after each row.
