\begin{problem}{E: Billy's Graph}
Billy is a big fan of Graph Theory.
When I say big, I mean he likes to invent types of graphs after himself because he wants to be a famous researcher in Graph Theory.
Billy has come up with his latest and greatest invention of a type of graph and wants to share it with you.
He calls these new graphs, Billy Graphs, they are indiciated by every edge sharing at least one node.

Billy is pretty good at Graph Theory and other mathematical disciplines but doesn't really care for programming.
He thinks its a lesser science.
Yet, here he is, asking you for help!
Billy wants a program to tell him if an abritrary graph is a Billy Graph or not and so he's come to you for help.

\begin{formalin}
The first line of input consists of two integers, $n$ ($3 \leq n \leq 1000$), the number of nodes, and $m$ ($2 \leq m \leq n^2$), the number of edges.
The next $m$ lines consists of two integers, $a$ and $b$, representing an edge between nodes $a$ and $b$.
\end{formalin}

\begin{formalout}
Output either \texttt{YES} if the graph is a Billy Graph, or \texttt{NO} otherwise.
