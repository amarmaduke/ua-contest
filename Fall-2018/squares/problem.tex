\begin{problem}{A: Squares}
A typical chess board consists of a grid of 8 by 8 squares. That leaves it with 64 squares that pieces can be moved to. How many squares of all sizes can be created when given an $n$ by $n$ chess board?

\begin{formalin}
The only line of input contains one integer, $n$ ($1 \leq n, \leq 2000$).
\end{formalin}
